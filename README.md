# Hi there, I’m @UmbrellaSkiies and this is my username and not my real one. 👋 

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I'm keen to work on a team that solves problems creatively. I am able to pick up new technology rapidly and put them to use. Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, and Wordpress are among my expertises. Four years ago, I self-taught these abilities.

## I'm a Full Stack Developer, Youtuber, Forex Trader, and a Photographer!!

- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything there is to learn about Technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Information Technology (IT)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project for the purpose of learning.
- 🥅 2023 Goals: Learn more about MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) Stack
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to trade forex and take photos / pictures at my spare time.
